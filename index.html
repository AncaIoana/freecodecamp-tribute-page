  <p> Nefertiti (also known as Neferneferuaten Nefertiti) was a queen of the  18th Dinasty of Ancient Egypt. She ruled alongside her husband Pharaoh Akhenaten. </p>
    <h4> Names and titles: </h4>
    <p> As it was customary for Egyptian royalty during those times, Nefertiti help many titles and was known under many names:  </p>
    <ul> 
      <li> Hereditary Princess </li>
      <li> Great of Praises</li>
      <li> Lady of Grace </li>
      <li> Sweet of Love </li>
      <li> Lady of The Two Lands </li>
      <li> Main King's Wife, his beloved </li>
      <li> Great King's Wife, his beloved </li>
      <li> Lady of All Women</li>
      <li> Mistress of Upper & Lower Egypt </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Why is Nefertiti famous? </h4>
    <p> While it was her extremely well preserved statue that brought Nefertiti to the attention of archeologists and of the entire world, her life proved to be even more fascinating. </p>
    <p> Nefertiti ruled as an equal along side her husband Akhenathen, and together they've brought radical (albeit short lived) changed to Ancient Egypt. For the first time in a polytheistic kingdom they've introduced monolatry and by an ever-increasing veneration ofthe god Aten (or the sun disc).  </p>
    <p> To better show their dedication to Aten, they moved the capital city from Thebes to the city of Akhetaten (modern day Amarna), where they raised large, open air temples deidcated to Aten. </p>
    <h4> Fascinating, but debated theories </h4>
    <p> One of the most interesting archeological hypothesis around Nefertiti is she rules as co-regent by her husband Akhenaten, and even that after his death, she ruled the Kingdom for several years as a Pharaohherself, until Tutankhamun took the throne.</p>
    <p> Another theory believed by many scolars is that Nefertiti was actually Tutankhamun's mother, and following the discontent provoked by their religious reforms, she raised Tutankhamun back in Thebes, and with the traditional gods. And to make things even more exciting, Tutankhamun was first named Tutankhaten (meaning <i>Living image of Aten</i>), and replaced by Tutankhamun (meaning <i>Living image of Amun</i>) after Akhenathen's dead.  </p>
    <p> And don't even get me started on the theories around her death and bural place! However if you want to know more about her life and legacy, check out her Wikipedia entry <a id="tribute-link" target = "_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti"> here.</a> </p>
